# AutoML

AutoML is an automated machine learning framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying machine learning models. This README provides an overview of the project, how to install and use it, and additional resources for further exploration.

## Features

- **Streamlined model building:** Automates the process of feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- **Supports various ML tasks:** Classification, regression, clustering, and more.
- **Customizable:** Allows users to specify constraints, objectives, and preferences for model generation.
- **Scalable:** Supports parallel processing for faster model training and evaluation.
